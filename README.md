### Binary Tree
 this challenge is about working with Binary trees, and Binary search trees, by creating a Node class that instantiate a new node with left and right, fot the child nodes, also work with Binary Search Trees.  

## We Worked as a group of Ahmad Almahasneh & Mohammed Alhawamdeh

### Fizz_Buzz_Tree
  we created a function called fizzbuzztree that types fizz if the number is divisible by 3 and type buzz if the number is divisible by 5 and type fizzbuzz if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 and type the number if it is not divisible by 3 and 5.
